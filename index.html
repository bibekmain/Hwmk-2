                <p> Hello and Namaskar. My name is Bibek Mainali. You can call me Bibek(bee-bek).  I was born and raised in the beautiful country of Nepal as a son of a struggling but happy family. As an only child, I have a lot of responsibilities so I have had my fair share of juggling work, school, health, and family matters. The expectations of an only child of an immigrant family are heavy, but that is the fuel I need to keep moving forward.<br><br>

                    Computer Science has interested me since the 5th grade. Since then I have been led down a rabbit hole of software, game, web, and app development. I am fascinated by how quickly the tech industry is moving forward and I want to be a big part of this worldwide change.<br/><br/>

                    I am a very fast learner and am eager to learn almost anything and everything that comes my way. I am a very curious person and will ask questions any time I am allowed to. I like to know the inner workings of things and this allows me to reduce my mistakes in my work. I work great with a team and I am very excited about learning to lead a team as well.<br/><br/>

                    I have experience in a handful of languages including C++, C#, Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a few more. My goal is to extend my knowledge to cloud and database related languages and frameworks. This summer (of 2023) I working on a web application that helps one track their macro nutrients and calories based on the brands they buy and the portions they eat. I am excited to work on this and although it will be challanging, there is no fun without any challange.<br/><br/>

                    I am currently a full-time undergrad exploring the Computer Science BS major as a freshman. My primary campus is Berkeley City College and my goal by the end of spring 2024 is to transfer to the well renown UC Berkeley. Their EECS program has alot to offer and I am up for the challange.
