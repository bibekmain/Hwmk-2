Advanced CSS Challenge: Professional Portfolio

This project is the landing page to my portfolio.
I will be adding more to this project as time goes on and as I complete newer projects.
There are 4 pages/sections to my webpage.
The Home page has the navigation bar and a quote I stick to.
The About page has a description about me and my life along with a picture of me that lights up on huver.
The Projects page has 5 projects that I will be adding on to. The first one being this landing webpage.
The last section, Contact, has some placeholder contact information that I will add on to once my professional webpage launches.
